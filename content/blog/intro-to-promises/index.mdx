JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. A thread, short for thread of execution, is a context in which the language can do work. In a multi-threaded language, one thread can handle a task while another thread simultaneously can work an a separate task. Humans, for example, are multi-threaded: You can scratch your head with one hand while surfing the internet with the other. In JavaScript, this means that only one task be be on the thread at a time, before it is completed and the next one begins. To put it more simply, you can only do one thing at a time.

This makes writing the code somewhat less complex, as it allows you to avoid [concurrency issues](https://www.educative.io/blog/multithreading-and-concurrency-fundamentals) which can happen when the work being done on multiple threads interfere with each other. However,  this also makes it difficult to perform long operations, such as requesting data from an API, without blocking the thread for an extended period of time.

Luckily, modern JavaScript has begun to implement features to handle these situations, known as asynchronous programming. These features include asynchronous callbacks, promises, and async/await functions. In this post, I am going to walk through the basics of promises and how to use them.

## What is a promise?

A promise is an special JavaScript object which will return a single value in the future: either a "resolved" value, or a reason it wasn't resolved, such as an error. It is called a promise because it is essentially an object which "promises" you a value in the future, but doesn't have it yet. Promises can exist in 3 states:

1. pending: a newly created promise which has yet to complete it's work.
2. rejected: a promise which has failed to complete its job,
3. fulfilled: a promise which has successfully completed its job

## Building a promise

The basic syntax for constructing a promise looks ike this:

```js
const promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // executor function
});
```

The `new Promise` syntax is know as the constructor, and it is used to create a new instance of a promise. The function we pass this constructor is known as the executor function, and will contain the work we want our promise to do. The executor function will be called automatically when the promise is created. The executor also takes two arguments, `resolve` and `reject`. These are callback functions pre-defined in JavaScript, and they are called in the executor depending on whether it was "successful" or not. If the executor was successful, it will call `resolve`, and the promise state will be changed to fulfilled. If it produced an error, then it will call `reject` and the state will be shifted to rejected. Here is an example of a promise function which will wait a specified amount of time before resolving:

```js
const hello = time => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, time))
```

In this example, we use es6 arrow function syntax, and we omit the `reject` argument. Both arguments are technically optional, so you can choose to only include the ones which you use.

## Chaining off a promise

All promises include a `.then()` method which you can call on the promise in order to utilize the resolved or rejected value.

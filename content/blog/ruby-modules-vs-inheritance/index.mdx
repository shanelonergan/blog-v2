Ruby is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language, and the Classes are the fundamental building blocks of OOP. Classes are blueprints for creating objects, and describe the behavior and properties each will have. Lets say, for example, you own a copy of The Great Gatsby by F. Scot Fitzgerald. That individual copy is an object, specifically a book. All books share specific properties, having a title, an author, number of pages, etc. Classes are the re-usable blueprint that let you  create each individual object.

Now, lets say you have multiple classes that share behaviors. Instead of rewriting all that code in each class, Ruby provides a few ways to create reusable code. In this post I will walk you through two ways to provide reusable behaviors to classes: inheritance and modules.

## Inheritance

If you want to create a class which has all of the attributes and methods of another class, but is more specified, you can use inheritance. By inheriting from a parent class, the child class will have access to all behaviors the parent has. For example, a `Singer` is a more specific version of a `Performer`, which is a more specific version of a `Person`. A `Performer` would inherit all the behavior of a `Person`, and a `Singer` would inherit from a `Performer`. In Ruby, it would look like this:

```ruby
class Person
end

class Performer < Person
end

class Singer < Performer
end
```

All methods and properties defined in Person will be available in Singer, but not everything in Singer will be available in Person. The most generic classes live at the top level, and things get more specific as you move down levels. Lets go ahead and build out this classes more to demonstrate.

```ruby
class Person
    def eat
        puts "Nom Nom Nom"
    end

    def drink
        puts "Slurp"
    end

    def sleep
        puts "ZZZzzz"
    end
end

class Performer < Person
    def razzle_dazzle
        puts "🎉 🎉 🎉"
    end
end

class Singer < Performer
    def sing
        puts "🎶 La La La 🎶"
    end
end
```

Now, we can create a few instances of these classes and see exactly who has access to which methods.

```ruby
john = Person.new
hugh = Performer.new
whitney = Singer.new

john.eat # ✅
john.razzle_dazzle # ❌
hugh.razzle_dazzle # ✅
hugh.sing # ❌
whitney.sing # ✅
whitney.razzle_dazzle # ✅
whitney.sleep # ✅
```

## Modules

What if we have a separated set of methods we wanted to be able to add to any class in any inheritance chain? We can use a module! A module is similar to a class in that it contains methods in order to be re-used. Modules can not be instantiated though, meaning you can not create a new instance using the `new` method. Modules can be included inside a class, giving that class to anything contained within the module.

```ruby
module BreathSupport
    def deep_breath
        puts "💨"
    end
end

class Singer < Performer
    include BreathSupport

    def sing
        puts "🎶 La La La 🎶"
    end
end

class Actor < Performer
    include BreathSupport

    def monologue
        puts "To be or not to be... 💀"
    end
end

audra = Singer.new
kenneth = Actor.new
audra.deep_breath # ✅
kenneth.deep_breath # ✅
```

Now any instance created from either the `Actor` or `Singer` class will have access to the `deep_breath` method defined inside the `BreathSupport` module.

## Inheritance vs Modules

So, when should you use a module instead of inheriting from a class? A good rule of thumb is to consider is whether or not you will want to create an instance based on the functionality you desire. If so, you will want to create a class as you cannot create instances of modules.
If not, you can likely use a module to accomplish the behavior you want, and it can be included in any classes which require it.

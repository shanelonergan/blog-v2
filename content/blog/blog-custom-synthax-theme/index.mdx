title: 'Adding A Custom Synthax Theme To Your Blog Using Prism-React-Renderer'
date: '2020-07-03'

This week, I decided to finally build a new blog. Previously, I had been publishing on medium and dev, but I figured it was time to create a centralized place for all my posts to live. I knew that I wanted to have support for MDX, and I had a great experince using Gatsby to build my [personal site](www.shanelonergan.dev), so I decided to use the [Gatsby Starter Blog MDX](https://github.com/hagnerd/gatsby-starter-blog-mdx) template. I knew I was going to use a custom color shceme for the blog, and I so of course I needed a synthax theme to match! In this post, I will walk you through created a custom synthax theme for a blog using [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

## Prerequisits

This guide will assume that you already have prism-react-rendering set up in your blog. If you do not, I would reccomend following the intallation instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer#installation). You can also check out this [guide](https://prince.dev/prism-react-renderer) about migrating from gatsby-remark-prismjs to prism-react-renderer by [Prince Wilson](https://twitter.com/maxcell).

## Changing the default theme

If you simply want to chnage your synthax theme to one of the commonly used, prism-react-renderer ships with a bunch out of the box. The default is duotone dark, but there are also some classics such as dracula and nightowl. You can find a full list [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/tree/master/src/themes).

To switch themes, you need to import it and then pass it as the value for the theme prop in the `Highlight` component.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Highlight, { defaultProps } from 'prism-react-renderer'
import dracula from 'prism-react-renderer/themes/dracula'

export const Code = ({ codeString, language, ...props }) => {
    return (
      <div className='code'>
        <Highlight
            {...defaultProps}
            code={codeString}
            language={language}
            theme={dracula}
        >
            {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
            <pre className={className} style={style}>
                {tokens.map((line, i) => (
                <div {...getLineProps({ line, key: i })}>
                    {line.map((token, key) => (
                    <span {...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
                    ))}
                </div>
                ))}
            </pre>
            )}
        </Highlight>
      </div>
    )
}
```

## Adding a custom theme

WWe are going to define our custome theme in a separate JavaScript file, and then import it just as we did in the last section. You can have this file live wherever you want, but I keep mine in a folder at `src/themes`. I would reccomend modeling your JS file after one of the [theme files](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/themes/dracula.js) in prism-react-renderer. The file will contain an object with two keys: `plain`, which defines the standard text and background colors; `styles`, where you can define colors and text styles based on individual keyword types. The dracula theme from prism-react-renderer file looks like this:

```ts
// prism-react-renderer/src/themes/dracula.js
import type { PrismTheme } from "../types";

var theme: PrismTheme = {
  plain: {
    color: "#F8F8F2",
    backgroundColor: "#282A36"
  },
  styles: [
    {
      types: ["prolog", "constant", "builtin"],
      style: {
        color: "rgb(189, 147, 249)"
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["inserted", "function"],
      style: {
        color: "rgb(80, 250, 123)"
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["deleted"],
      style: {
        color: "rgb(255, 85, 85)"
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["changed"],
      style: {
        color: "rgb(255, 184, 108)"
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["punctuation", "symbol"],
      style: {
        color: "rgb(248, 248, 242)"
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["string", "char", "tag", "selector"],
      style: {
        color: "rgb(255, 121, 198)"
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["keyword", "variable"],
      style: {
        color: "rgb(189, 147, 249)",
        fontStyle: "italic"
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["comment"],
      style: {
        color: "rgb(98, 114, 164)"
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["attr-name"],
      style: {
        color: "rgb(241, 250, 140)"
      }
    }
  ]
};

export default theme;
```

To modify this file, I am first going to remove the types since I am not using TypeScript. Then, I will define a set of color variables at the top of the file.

```js
// src/themes/1976.js
const darkBrown= '#744f25'
const brown = '#2b1d0e'
const yellow = '#f1d248'
const orange = '#fe8c1b'
const red = '#fb4f28'
const teal = '#8ff0e0'
const cream = '#fffbf1'

const theme = {
    // ...
}

```

Now, time for the fun part! Experiment with which colors you want to assign to the different keywords. My configuration is tsill a work in progress, but currently looks like this:

```js
const darkBrown = '#744f25'
const brown = '#2b1d0e'
const yellow = '#f1d248'
const orange = '#fe8c1b'
const red = '#fb4f28'
const teal = '#8ff0e0'
const cream = '#fffbf1'

const theme = {
  plain: {
    color: cream,
    backgroundColor: brown
  },
  styles: [
    {
      types: ["prolog", "constant", "builtin", "important", "deleted", "type", "attr-name"],
      style: {
        color: red
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["inserted", "function"],
      style: {
        color: yellow
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["changed"],
      style: {
        color: yellow
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["punctuation", "symbol"],
      style: {
        color: teal
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["string", "char", "selector"],
      style: {
        color: teal
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["keyword", "variable", "boolean", "number"],
      style: {
        color: orange,
        fontStyle: "italic"
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["comment"],
      style: {
        color: darkBrown
      }
    },
    {
      types: ["tag"],
      style: {
        color: yellow
      }
    }
  ]
};

export default theme;
```

Notice how you can set some keywords to be italic with the `fontStyle` attribute in the `style` object.

Once you are done with your theme, you just need to import it and then pass it as the value for the theme prop in the `Highlight` component, as we did when changing the default theme.

## Congrats!

You can now make a custome synthax theme for your code symples using prism-react-renderer. Thank you so much for reading, and best of luck with your themes!

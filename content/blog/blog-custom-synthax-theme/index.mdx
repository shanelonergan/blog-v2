This week, I decided to finally build a new blog. Previously, I had been publishing on medium and dev, but I figured it was time to create a centralized place for all my posts to live. I knew that I wanted to have support for MDX, and I had a great experince using Gatsby to build my [personal site](www.shanelonergan.dev), so I decided to use the [Gatsby Starter Blog MDX](https://github.com/hagnerd/gatsby-starter-blog-mdx) template. I knew I was going to use a custom color shceme for the blog, and I so of course I needed a synthax theme to match! In this post, I will walk you through created a custom synthax theme for a blog using [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

## Prerequisits

This guide will assume that you already have prism-react-rendering set up in your blog. If you do not, I would reccomend following the intallation instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer#installation). You can also check out this [guide](https://prince.dev/prism-react-renderer) about migrating from gatsby-remark-prismjs to prism-react-renderer by [Prince Wilson](https://twitter.com/maxcell).
